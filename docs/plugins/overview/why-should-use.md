# Why You Should Try It ?

We developed modular plugins to empower our partners to extend the capabilities of the Wazo portal and applications. Hereâ€™s why partners should take advantage of this feature:

- **Customization**: Enable partners to tailor our applications to meet their specific customer needs by adding new features and functionalities.
- **Simplified Support**: Provide an easy and efficient way to integrate new features without complicating the existing system.
- **Optimized Performance**: Reduce the overall size and complexity of our applications by loading only the features that are necessary, leaving out those that are not in use.
- **Code Separation**: Facilitate the separation of source code from the main application, especially when dealing with incompatible software licenses.
- **Focus on Core Competencies**: Allow company experts to concentrate on enhancing the core elements of our products, leaving customization to partners.
- **Centralized Management**: Give partners' administrators a centralized location to install, manage, and monitor plugins for their customers. This includes visibility into which customers have specific plugins enabled. Looking ahead, customers may also gain the ability to install their plugins.
