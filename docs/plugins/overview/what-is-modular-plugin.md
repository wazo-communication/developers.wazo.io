# What is a Modular Plugin?

A modular plugin is a software component that can be independently developed, added to, or removed from a system without impacting its core functionality. These plugins are designed to be modular, meaning they can function as standalone units while still interacting seamlessly with the main application or platform.

Key characteristics of modular plugins include:

1. **Flexibility**: They allow users to customize and extend the functionality of the main system according to specific needs without altering the core software.
2. **Interoperability**: Modular plugins can interact with the core system and other plugins, enhancing the systemâ€™s overall capabilities.
3. **Ease of Integration**: They are typically designed for smooth integration into the existing architecture of a software platform.
4. **Isolation**: Since they operate independently, issues or bugs in one plugin do not necessarily affect the rest of the system.

In the context of Wazo, modular plugins enable partners to add new features or components to the Wazo platform, allowing them to offer more customized solutions to their customers. These plugins are hosted and managed by the partners, giving them the autonomy to innovate and differentiate their offerings.

The beauty of modular plugins lies in their ability to facilitate customization, potentially opening new markets and attracting new customer types without requiring extensive changes to our core codebase. Beyond this, plugins provide a way to extend the product's capabilities in general.

For example:

- Extending phone desk provisioning within the core of Wazo.
- Developing APIs for microservices.
- Adding new APIs to the core platform.
- Using the Modular Plugin framework to quickly develop Proofs of Concept (POCs) without affecting production environments.

Modular plugins empower partners to incorporate new features and third-party libraries into our applications, interacting with and extending our products in every possible way.

These plugins must be hosted on the partner's infrastructure, giving them full control over the technologies they use and the timing of plugin updates.
