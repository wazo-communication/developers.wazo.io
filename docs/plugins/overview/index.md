# Modular Plug-Ins Introduction

We developed an easy way to integrate Modular Plug-Ins inside our products. This solution enable any developers to add components that enhance the Wazo platform's feature set. By doing so, partners can deliver more comprehensive solutions to their customers without requiring them to use multiple products to meet their communication needs.

At Wazo, we aim to concentrate our efforts on our core strengths while integrating additional features through third-party development. This approach provides our partners with more options, allowing them to offer a more complete platform to their end-users. We recognize that effective collaboration and communication are essential for organizations to stay connected with their customers and maintain internal team cohesion. Therefore, our objective is to streamline this process for our partners. By empowering them with greater autonomy, we aim to reduce their dependence on our development queue for new features, enabling them to achieve greater success in their business.

By allowing our partners to tailor their business models and add value for their end customers, we provide them with the means to differentiate themselves and enhance their products and services. Wazo offers numerous extension points, all of which can be combined to create comprehensive features for your preferred PBX system.

For Wazo, this strategy also highlights the importance of focusing our efforts on specific use cases. If we don't, we risk being in a constant cycle of adding tweaks and functionalities to satisfy every partner's unique needs, which is unsustainable for building a cohesive platform.

The Modular Plug-Ins are hosted and managed by the partner, separate from Wazo. Wazo will likely need to offer some level of observability, allowing partners to quickly diagnose whether an issue lies within their code or with Wazoâ€™s APIs.
