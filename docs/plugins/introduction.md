## Use Cases

Here's some ideas on how to extend our products, imagination is our only limitation here.

### E-UC Apps

- **SMS**: With plugins, you can add in an SMS provider to our app. Add a new tab from the plugin manifest and connect it to your favorite SMS provider. Starting from there, you can add new sophisticated functionalities of your choice.
- **CRM**: Match all incoming calls to any CRM, even any internal CRM with an API Available.
- **Internal Tools**: Add a wide range of tools to help your organization. From a simple list of documents to an integrated calculation tool that helps your sales team during a call.

### E-UC Portal

- **Realtime dashboard**: Add a new tab inside your stack's dashboard to show realtime metrics. This dashboard could be built to show specific KPIs or any other data from an external API.
- **Extend any form**: Plugins allow you to add any tabs in any form. You could map information related to any users, devices, or conferences from an external or internal system.
- **Support Center Dashboard**: Add your own support center page to help your customers troubleshoot problems or contact the support team.

### E-UC Stack

- **CRM**: A plugin can be developed to integrate the PBX server with a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. This integration can allow for call logging, call recording, and call analytics to be directly linked with customer data.
- **AI-Powered Routing**: A plugin can be developed to leverage AI and machine learning algorithms to route calls based on various factors such as caller sentiment, call history, and availability of agents.
- **Real-time Analytics**: A plugin can be developed to provide a real-time analytics dashboard that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as call volume, average call duration, and customer satisfaction scores.
